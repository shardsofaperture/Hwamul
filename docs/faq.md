# FAQ / Troubleshooting

## Why does Save fail?
Validation errors show the exact row and field. Fix those values and retry.

## Why are my dates rejected?
Use `YYYY-MM-DD` (example: `2026-01-31`).

## Why can't I find a SKU in Pack rules?
SKU list is supplier-specific. Check supplier and search filter.

## Why is no rate card selected in Rate Test?
Check `is_active`, date range, scope, equipment, lane, and optional flags.
