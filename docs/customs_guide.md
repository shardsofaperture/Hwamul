# Customs Guide

Use **Admin → Customs / HTS** to track customs reporting attributes over time.

Track per effective period:
- HTS code and material input.
- Country of origin and tariff program.
- Base duty and tariff add-on rates.
- Tariff rate notes to explain period-to-period changes.
- Section 232 / Section 301 applicability.
- Whether domestic trucking and port-to-ramp services are required.
- Whether special documentation is required, plus notes.
- Documentation link/path and handling tips for broker-ready packets.

Recommended workflow:
1. Add one row per `HTS + COO + tariff_program + effective_from`.
2. Keep date windows non-overlapping where possible for clean reporting.
3. Maintain tariff rate notes for audit context on rate changes over time.
4. Add documentation links and tips so teams can quickly upload/share the right packet for each code.
5. Export bundles from **Data management** for historical tracking.
