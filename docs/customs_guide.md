# Customs Guide

Use **Admin → Customs / HTS** to maintain customs reporting attributes over time.

## What to track per effective period
- HTS code and material/input context.
- Country of origin and tariff program.
- Base duty and tariff add-on rates.
- Tariff-rate notes to explain changes.
- Section 232 / Section 301 applicability.
- Domestic service requirements (e.g., domestic trucking, port-to-ramp).
- Documentation requirement flags, links, and handling notes.

## Recommended workflow
1. Add one row per `HTS + COO + tariff_program + effective_from` combination.
2. Keep effective windows non-overlapping where practical.
3. Record notes whenever tariff or section applicability changes.
4. Keep documentation links current so broker packets are easy to assemble.
5. Periodically export data bundles for historical traceability.

## Operational tips
- Review customs rows before major shipment cycles.
- Confirm documentation-required flags are aligned with current trade/compliance policy.
